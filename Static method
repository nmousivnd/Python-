Challenge : The given code takes 2 numbers as input and calls the static area() method of the Shape class, to output the area of the shape, which is equal to the height multiplied by the width.


Code: 

class Shape:
    @staticmethod
    def validate_numbers(width, height):
        # Ensure the numbers are positive integers
        return width > 0 and height > 0

    @staticmethod
    def area(width, height):
        # Validate inputs
        if not Shape.validate_numbers(width, height):
            return "Invalid dimensions"
        # Calculate the area
        return width * height


# Get input for width and height
w = int(input())
h = int(input())

# Print the area or an error message
print(Shape.area(w, h))
